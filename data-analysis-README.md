# Data Analysis Script

This Jupyter notebook performs the final data analysis on the Eugene crisis response dataset, including statistical tests, modeling, and visualization of results.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* Jupyter Notebook/Lab
* Required libraries:
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * scikit-learn
  * statsmodels (for statistical testing)

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have completed the previous steps:
  
  * Run `datacleaning-final.ipynb` first to generate `clean_data.csv`
2. If you want to use an example, small dataset for reference:
  
  * Navigate to the `project-data` folder
  * Use `sample_clean_data.csv`
3. Install required dependencies:

2. Open `data-analysis.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface
  
3. Run all cells:
  
  * Use Cell â†’ Run All or run each cell with Shift+Enter
  * Pay attention to markdown cells for explanation of analysis steps
  * Some analyses or model training may take time to complete
