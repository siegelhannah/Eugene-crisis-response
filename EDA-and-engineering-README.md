# Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

This Jupyter notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned Eugene crisis response dataset.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* Jupyter Notebook/Lab
* Required libraries:
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have run `datacleaning-script.ipynb` first:
  
  * This EDA notebook requires the `clean_data.csv` file generated by the data cleaning script
  * If you haven't run it, please do so before proceeding
2. Extract raw data files (if you need to reference them):
  
  * Navigate to the `project-data` folder
  * Extract the contents of `zipped-raw-data.zip` in the same directory
3. Install required dependencies:
  
      pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  

## Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:
  
      jupyter notebook
  
  or
  
      jupyter lab
  
2. Open `EDA-and-engineering.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface
  
3. Run all cells in sequence:
  
  * Use Cell â†’ Run All or run each cell with Shift+Enter
  * Each section is documented with markdown explanations
  * Some visualizations may take time to render, especially with large datasets

## Key Sections

The notebook contains several key sections:

* Initial data exploration
* visualization of call volumes and environmental variables over time ( + Time series visualizations)
* Correlation between specific variables
* Distributions of call types
* Determining findings: the key relationships to investigate/statistical tests to do for the analysis section
* Drafting analytical steps

## Output

This notebook primarily focuses on exploration and doesn't necessarily generate new data files, but may:

* Create temporary transformed datasets
* Generate visualizations for understanding the data

## Important Notes

* Some exploratory visualizations may be computationally intensive
* The insights from this notebook inform the subsequent analysis
* Please review the markdown cells for detailed explanations of findings
